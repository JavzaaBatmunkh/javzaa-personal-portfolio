            I am a passionate, <u>self-proclaimed designer</u> who specializes
            in full stack development React.js & Node.js. I am very enthusiastic
            about bringing the technical and visual aspects of digital products
            to life. User experience, pixel perfect design, and writing clear,
            readable, highly performant code matters to me.

            in my early thirties, 7 years after starting my web development
            journey, I am building cutting-edge web applications using modern

            Supabase and much more.
